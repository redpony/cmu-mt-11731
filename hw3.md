# Homework 3

**Due 11:59pm on Tuesday, Apr. 2, 2013**

## Getting started

Go to your clone of your course GitHub repository on the machine where you will be doing this assignment, and run the following command to obain the code and data you will need:

    ./tools/get-new-assignments

## The Challenge

## Ground Rules

 * You may work in independently or in groups of any size, under these conditions:
    * You must notify us by posting a public note to piazza including the e-mails of everyone who will be working in the group (max=3).
    * Everyone in the group will receive the same grade on the assignment.
    * Once you have formed a group, you may **not** disband until the next homework.

 * You must turn in the following by submitting to the public GitHub repository
    * `hw3/output.txt`
    * `hw3/README.md` - a brief description of the algorithms you tried.
    * `hw3/...` - your source code and revision history. We want to see evidence of *regular progress* over the course of the project. You don't have to `git push` to the public repository unless you want to, but you should be committing changes with `git add` and `git commit`. We expect to see evidence that you are trying things out and learning from what you see.
