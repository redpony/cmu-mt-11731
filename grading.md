# Grading

## Reading responses (10 responses, 1 point each)

Each week you must read and post a comment to Piazza on **two** of the recommended readings per week. To receive credit for a response, it must be posted before class starts on the day the reading is assigned. The response should be about one paragraph and should be a summary suitable for explaining the material

## Homeworks (4 assignments, 10 points each)

A major part of your grade will be four competitive homework assignments focusing on important subproblems in machine translation: word alignment, automatic translation evaluation, decoding, and system building.

You will earn a passing grade (7 points) by correctly implementing a standard algorithm that is indicated for each assignment. Additional credit will be given for building the best system according to an automatic evaluation criterion: 6 points for the best system, 5 points for the second best, etc. In the unlikely event of a perfect tie, the student or group submitting their results first will rank higher. The long and short of it is: to receive an A in this class, you must compete!

 * Alignment: given a set of translated documents that are aligned at the sentence level, identify the words that are translations of each other.
 * Decoding: find the most probable translation of a sentence, given a translation model and a new input sentence.
 * Evaluation: design a metric of translation accuracy that correlates with human judgement.
 * Reranking: find the most accurate translation of a sentence, given an input and a list of ranked alternative translations.

## In-Class Presentation: Language in Ten Minutes (10 points)

Developing effective translation models and systems requires knowing how languages work. You will be required to give a 10-minute presentation on a particular language that you do not speak natively.

You should prepare three to six content slides for your presentation. The following points should be covered:

 * Demographics, location, number of speakers
 * Important typological characteristics (morphology, syntax, information structure)
 * Computational challenges: orthographic issues, existence of corpora, parsers, and other tools
 * Previous work in machine translation

Ethnologue, Omniglot, About World Languages, and the Machine Translation Archive, previous courses that have used this assignment at Johns Hopkins and Columbia.

Presentations will be graded on thoroughness, clarity, and conciseness.

## Course Projects (40 points)

Your course project will be a substantial research effort carried out by each student or groups of students (max group size = 3). It should have clearly articulated purpose, evaluation plan.

The milestones will be:
 * Pre-project proposal meeting with instructor (**2 points**)
 * Project proposal (**8 points**; 2 pages), due February 28
   * What problem are you going to solve? (You must give a concrete *example* illustrating the problem you are trying to solve.)
   * What is your proposed solution?
   * What is your implementation plan?
   * How will you evaluate your results?
 * Final project report (**20 points**; 8 pages), due May 8
   * Explain your implementation and evaluation.
   * Discuss prior and related work.
   * Analyze your results.
   * Answer the question: what did you learn?
 * Final project poster (**10 points**), during exam period

The proposal is a contract. If we give you full credit for it, that means we expect you to implement it and do a good analysis of the results, and we will give you full credit for the entire project if you do. If you turn in a weak proposal, we will give you the opportunity to submit a revised one before moving forward, but the longer you take to define your project, the less time you will have to implement it, so it's in your best interest to take advantage of this early checkpoint.

Before the proposal is due, you should make an appointment with one of the instructors in order to discuss project ideas; this will enable you to submit a proposal with full confidence that it will be well-received. Before meeting with us, you might want to browse over topics that we'll be covering later in the term, since these might suggest ideas to you. We will however give you fairly wide latitude to choose a topic as long as it's related in some way to translation and is technically interesting, so you should not feel restricted to these topics. We can suggest topics to you in individual meetings if you're stumped, but it will help us to know what your interests and strengths are, so be prepared to tell us what you're curious about.

Groups projects of any size are permitted, but we will require an amount of work that is linear in group size, so you should take into account the overhead of group coordination when forming groups. Each group should turn in a single proposal identifying all members. All group members will receive the same grade, and you are stuck with your group members once your proposal is finalized: we refuse to adjudicate stories about who did or did not contribute. Choose your partners carefully.

## Late work policy

Homeworks are due at 11:59pm on the date specified.

However, since the world is a complicated place full of illnesses, job interviews, and conference deadlines, each of you gets *10 late days* to use during the term (1 day = 24 consecutive hours). These are only intended to cover situations where you would normally ask the instructors for an extension. Rather than ask us, just use a late day. If you *do* ask us, we will say "Use a late day!". Once you have no late days left, your homeworks will receive no points. **We will not grant extra late days, even for special circumstances.**

Note: leaderboard ranking for the purposes of obtaining points will be determined at the deadline. Late submissions will enable you to receive a passing grade, but not to displace more punctual students.
