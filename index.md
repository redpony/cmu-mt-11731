## Overview

Welcome to Machine Translation (11-731). This 12-credit graduate course will provide a comprehensive overview of current techniques in machine translation, such as those used by [Google Translate](http://translate.google.com/) and [Bing Translator](http://www.bing.com/translator). This course is a survey of methods in machine translation, including the traditional noisy channel formulation of Brown et al. (1993), phrase- and syntax-based models that were introduced in the 2000's, and neural-network models that have become popular in the last several years. This is a programming-heavy course that focuses on implementation and experimentation.

## Piazza

This semester we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is designed to get you help fast and efficiently from classmates, Wang, Alon, and me. *Rather than emailing questions to the instructors, we encourage you to post your questions on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/cmu/spring2016/11731/home)*. It supports LaTeX for equations, syntax highlighting for code and keeps all materials related to the course in one place.

[Find our class page here.](https://piazza.com/cmu/spring2016/11731/home)

## Freely Available (Parallel) Corpora

 * [WIT<sup>3</sup>](https://wit3.fbk.eu/) is a transcribed corpus of [TED talks](http://www.ted.com/talks) in many languages (small/medium).
 * The Workshop on Machine Translation hosts annually a translation competition for which they provide free training and evaluation resources. Different years have somewhat different sets of languages. [2016](http://statmt.org/wmt16/translation-task.html), [2015](http://statmt.org/wmt15/translation-task.html), [2014](http://statmt.org/wmt14/translation-task.html), [2013](http://statmt.org/wmt13/translation-task.html), [2012](http://statmt.org/wmt12/translation-task.html) (medium/large)
